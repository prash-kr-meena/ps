Find GCD (HCF) of two numbers

GCD : Greatest Common Division
HCF : Highest Common Factor



Note : Python already has support for GCD in its math library   , We can pass as many number as we like in the gcd method
        we can assume that the internal gcd() method uses the  Euclideanâ€™s theorem
        Whose time complexity comes to be   O(lg min(a,b))

    Idea is exactly the same as of the brute force, the only difference is we are going to short circuit the logic

    Then the first common divisor will be our Greatest Common Divisor, and we would not need to travel completely till 1
