#### Learn the basics

1. Things to Know in C++/Java/Python or any language
    1. [Python Output Formatting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-output-formatting/)
    2. [Iterate over multiple lists simultaneously `zip` _(smallest by default)_, `zip_longest`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-iterate-multiple-lists-simultaneously/)
    3. [Accept multiple arguments to a method &nbsp;&nbsp; **or** <br>Variable-length arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`) in Python](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-args-kwargs-usage/)
2. Build-up Logical Thinking
    1. [Must do Pattern Problems before starting DSA](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/must-do-pattern-problems-before-starting-dsa/)
    2. [Patterns Code](1_Basics/2_PatternProblems/patterns.py)
3. Collections in Python
4. Basic Math
    1. [Count digits in a number](1_Basics/4_Math/count_digits.py)
    2. [Reverse a number](1_Basics/4_Math/reverse_a_number.py)
    3. [check_palindrome_number](1_Basics/4_Math/check_palindrome_number.py)
        1. Variations : With Space, Without space, When number is very huge that it can't fit long
    4. [GCD or HCF of two numbers](1_Basics/4_Math/gcd_and_lcm/gcd_of_two_numbers.py)
        1. [GCD or HCF of Multiple numbers](1_Basics/4_Math/gcd_and_lcm/gcd_of_multiple_numbers.py)
    5. [LCM of two numbers](1_Basics/4_Math/gcd_and_lcm/lcm_of_two_numbers.py)
        1. [LCM of multiple numbers](1_Basics/4_Math/gcd_and_lcm/lcm_of_multiple_numbers.py) : What's the catch here?
    6. [Armstrong Number](1_Basics/4_Math/armstrong_number.py)
    7. [All Divisors of a Number](1_Basics/4_Math/all_divisors.py)
5. Recursion
    * For Recursion the absolute OG is Aditya Verma
    * [Recursion Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWeT1ffjiImo0sYTcnLzo-wY) This should be more than enough to understand recursion
    * **TODO** -> Will do these recursion problem when I revise recursion from my notes of these videos, till then I can move on
6. Hashing
    * [Count frequency of each element in the array](1_Basics/6_Hashing/count_frequenc_of_array_elements.py)
    * [Find the highest/lowest frequency element](1_Basics/6_Hashing/find_highest_and_lowest_frequency_element.py)
7. Sorting
    * [selection_sort](2_Sorting/selection_sort.py)
        * In the normal Selection sort (asc order)
        * We traverse from let to right and
        * The sorted array is also build form left to right direction
        * Basically : Here we push the smallest element to the first
    * [bubble_sort](2_Sorting/bubble_sort.py)
        * In the normal Bubble sort (asc order)
        * We traverse from let to right and
        * But The sorted array is build form right to left direction
        * Basically : Here we push the largest element to the end
    * [insertion_sort](2_Sorting/insertion_sort.py)
        * Insertion sort is a bit trickier than selection and bubble sort,
        * and its is also used in many other places, with some modification
        * e.g. Quick sort's partision step

        - [ ]  To be verified

    * [Difference Bw Selection Sort and Insertion Sort]()
    * [merge_sort](2_Sorting/merge_sort.py)
    * [quick_sort](2_Sorting/quick_sort.py)

### Uncategorized

* [Frequency of the Most Frequent Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element/)
    * suggested under [Find the highest/lowest frequency element](1_Basics/6_Hashing/find_highest_and_lowest_frequency_element.py)
    * But it does not fit there
