Find LCM of two numbers
LCM : Lowest common multiple


Note : Python already has support for LCM in its math library,   We can pass as many number as we like in the lcm method
        we can assume that the internal gcd() method uses the  Euclideanâ€™s theorem
        Whose time complexity comes to be   O(lg min(a,b))

    LCM =  ___a x b___

    Note : This above formula does not apply for number more than 2
